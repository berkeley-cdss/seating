One stop solution to manage and access exam seating assignments of all your Berkeley courses, for course staff and students.

Check out our [presentation slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UHyHwxE06L7hX2fEE3_JUhLN5CMolUJt7WaZstIjMXA/edit?usp=sharing) for Berkeley Teaching & Learning Conference 2024.

## Introduction

The app allows you to manage all your course exams. As course staff, you will be able to create, edit and delete exams, rooms/seats and student rosters, manage seating assignment, and email students about their assignments. As a student, you will be able to see your seating assignments.

The app is behind Canvas (bCourses) authentication, so only Berkeley affiliates can access the app. Only individuals that are enrolled in a certain course can access the app for that course - the type of enrollment (student, staff, etc.) fetched from Canvas determines the level of access.

## Features and Benefits

- Supports multiple exams for the same course. 
- Supports multiple room and multiple sessions for the same exam.
- Automates seat assignment and room allocation, reducing the workload on staff and minimizing human errors.
- Ensures fair seating arrangements for all students taking the exam, while taking into account student seating and room preferences (e.g. lefty chair, small room, DSP accommodation etc).
- Securely stores sensitive student and exam data, abiding by FERPA and other privacy laws, allowing only authorized staff to access the data.
- Allows exam seating email notification and seating chart projection during the exam.
- Allows staff to easily identify cheaters during exams by seating location.
