"""
Canvas ids are whole numbers, and a student is found on logging in by their Canvas id, so a student
imported with any other canvas id could never find their seat. (Student urls used to hold the Canvas
id too, which left such students impossible to open, edit or delete, #43; they now use database ids.)
Imports skip such rows and say why. The values below are ones found in real imports: a TRUE/FALSE
column read as canvas ids, and long Canvas ids a spreadsheet turned into scientific notation.
